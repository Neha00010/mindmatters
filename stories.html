                Elaine Lek, a suicide survivor, describes the tragic morning of September 28, 2018, when her eldest son Zen Dylan Koh took his own life in his college dormitory in Melbourne, Australia. "I was only five minutes away from the hotel to the house, but it was the longest run of my life. The paramedics were attempting to revive Zen when she got to the scene. He was promptly taken to the hospital, where he spent the next three days fighting for his life. By the third day, the doctors informed Elaine and her husband that Zen has a very tiny chance of surviving. He chose me to be his mother for 17 years and 11 months, and I thanked him for that. I observed him wiping away tears. The same night, Zen passed away in the presence of his loved ones. Elaine and her husband donated his organs in commemoration of him and his desire to aid others. Elaine explains, "Zen sacrificed his own life, but he gave back to six lives in Melbourne. They carry on his legacy. Elaine uncovered an explanation for her family's devastating loss after Zen's passing on his phone, where he had written about wanting to be a psychologist. "This provides me a sense of what I can do to give his and my own lives meaning. And at that point, my husband and I chose Limitless to establish the Zen Dylan Koh Fund, according to Elaine.

                A DJ mixes minimal electronic sounds as the room's lights dim and dancers whirl over the floor—some awkwardly, others wildly.
                Although the atmosphere is laid-back, the dancers are preparing to become volunteers for Over The Rainbow, a nonprofit organisation that supports mental health and wellness.
                The volunteers are participating in a variety of programmes, including the music workshop, to learn about different approaches to mental health care and eventually help lead similar sessions.
                Founder Chow Yen-Lu, who founded Over The Rainbow with his wife Yee Ling after the couple lost their son, who suffered from manic depression, to suicide in 2009, is there for the session.
                The couple felt compelled to act as they dealt with the anguish and sadness of losing Lawrance, their only child.
                He can't be the only one who is hurting, my wife and I were discussing, Yen-Lu added. We don't have any training in mental health, but how can we be of use?
                They established Over The Rainbow in 2012 to offer free mental health resources to young people, including support groups, courses on creative and spiritual therapies, and informational articles.
                The aim? a secure environment where people can get the resources they need to take care of their mental health.
                From our own experiences, "I knew that the only thing that would be sustainable is looking at prevention, self-care, and taking ownership," says Yen-Lu. "This thing that will keep you going for the rest of your life is mental wellness."
                Lim Yan Ling, one of the volunteers taking part in the programme, came into contact with Over The Rainbow in 2018 while looking for strategies to aid her in processing her mental health journey.

                “Schizophrenia is not crazy”, 45-year-old I Nyoman Sudiasa proudly declares.
                Powerful  words from someone who, up till four years ago, didn’t realise that he had been living with the disorder for over a decade. Sitting under the Bali sun, he recalls how his symptoms surfaced at age 27. 
                “I felt something strange in me. I began to get nervous, feel anxious and suspicious of others, including my wife. I felt that everyone around me was always watching me and I felt so depressed.”
                His wife, Ni Putu Sri Ayu Astuti, became distressed as she struggled with his mood swings, mistrust, and inability to hold down a job. The emotional and financial strain almost caused her to leave him but she persevered for the sake of the children, and because her family convinced her to stay.  
                Despite numerous visits to the hospital, Nyoman and his wife were left baffled as to what was causing the changes in his behaviour and his ability to think and reason.
                It was only when he met psychiatrist Dr I Gusti Rai Wiguna, that he finally found an answer to the mystery causing him and his family so much anguish — schizophrenia, an extreme mental health condition that affects an estimated 21 million people worldwide.
